## Overview

EMPO (Entropy Minimized Policy Optimization) does not require any supervised information for incentivizing reasoning capabilities (i.e., neither verifiable reasoning traces, problems with golden answers, nor additional pre-trained reward models). By continuously minimizing the predictive entropy of LLMs on unlabeled user queries, EMPO enables self-supervised RL for reasoning capabilities.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains **two self-contained implementations** of EMPO:

- [`trl`](./trl/README.md): Based on Hugging Faceâ€™s trl, a cutting-edge library designed for post-training foundation models.

&nbsp;&nbsp; â†³ Built on commit [v0.14-release](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/commits/v0.14-release)

- [`verl-empo`](./verl-empo/README.md): Based on VERL, a high-performance RL training library designed for LLMs.

&nbsp;&nbsp; â†³ Built on commit [v0.4x](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/tree/v0.4.x)


Both are licensed under Apache 2.0 and include their respective `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` files.

## TRL Quick Start (deprecated)

> Developed upon trl 0.14.0. See [`trl`](./trl/README.md) for details.

```
cd trl
pip install -r requirements.txt
sh empo-1.5B-NM-COT-20K.sh
```

As trl 0.14.0 is already a relatively outdated training framework. We highly recommend verl for further development for efficiency and compatibility.

## Verl Quick Start
> Developed upon verl==0.4.x. See [`verl`](./verl/README.md) for details.

The recommended docker image with pre-built dependency is verlai/verl:app-verl0.4-vllm0.8.5-mcore0.13.0-preview.

### Data Preparation

Place the train and val data from ['math_data'](./math_data) in your local path.


### Train with EMPO

```
cd verl-empo
sh recipe/empo/scripts/run_empo_qwen2.5_math_7b.sh
```

Remember to modify the code [here](https://github.com/QingyangZhang/EMPO/blob/c0cfff769a8c926134d10423d6db3d4dd2adb913/verl-empo/verl/utils/tracking.py#L43C13-L43C160) if you want to track the training dynamics with Wandb.

### Evaluation

Load verl checkpoints by modifying trainer.resume_from_path.

Calculate pass@1 accuracy with greedy decoding by setting actor_rollout_ref.rollout.val_kwargs.do_sample=False.

### Experimental Results

We report pass@1 with greedy decoding for all datasets.

Noted that due to different 1) evaluation proxy 2) RL framework and 3) GPU hardware, the above results are different from those reported in our early preprint.
